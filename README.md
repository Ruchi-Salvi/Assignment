## Features  
- **List all courses**: Fetches and returns a list of course names from Brainlox.  
- **Search for courses**: Allows users to find relevant courses based on a query using TF-IDF similarity.  
- **Health check**: Ensures the API is running.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Flask, Requests, BeautifulSoup)  
- **Machine Learning** (TF-IDF Vectorization, Cosine Similarity)
